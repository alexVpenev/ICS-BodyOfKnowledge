        <p>
            Below is the planning that I created at the start of the semester. I can confidently say that I adhered to it throughout the entire semster, although with an exception. While I completed all the exercises within the given time frame, there was a considerable time lapse between finishing them and writing them into the BoK. Nevertheless, I am pleased with how things turned out as I managed to finish all the topics within the deadlines.

        <!-- The picture below is the planning that I created at the beginning of the semester. In a way I could say that I stuck to it through the entire semester.
            I am saying in a way because I have done all of the exercises in the time-slot that I planned for, but the issue was that there was quite a while between 
            finishing the exercises and actually adding them to the BoK. But in the end, I am happy from how things went, I have finished every topic from this semester
            in the deadlines slots.  -->

        <p>
            While working on this BoK, I gained a significant amount of new knowledge in offensive and defensive security, despite my background being primarily in software. Initially lacking in infrastructure knowledge, I kept working and reading and I think I understood all the topics to be able to
            finish this semester successfully. While writing, I found certain topics to be particularly interesting, and I came to realize that to be a well-rounded IT specialist, it is imperative to have a comprehensive understanding of offensive and defensive security, and hardware/networking in general. This newfound interest has inspired me to continue my studies in the field and pursue certifications such as CCNA and Pentest+. Moving forward, I intend to follow the Fontys Security Specialization curriculum in the upcoming semesters. As for the Learning Outcomes, I can confidently say I showcased my learnings across the different topics.
