            This is the first topic I'll cover out of the Network Security theme. Here I will begin by covering the concept of what Network Scanning is, I will try to go more in
            depth into the topic and the technology that surrounds it. I will also describe the scanning process of a network, and finally show some examples of how scanning works
            along with some final thoughts.
