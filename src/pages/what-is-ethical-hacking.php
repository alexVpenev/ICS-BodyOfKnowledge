            In the first week of the specialization, we were introduced to the concept of ethical hacking, as well as the various types of hackers and hacking techniques.
            However, it is crucial to remember that engaging in hacking activities without proper authorization is illegal and can result in legal consequences.
            The only exception is when you have explicit written permission or a contract with the owner of the IT environment you're testing, or if you're testing your own environment.

            Ethical hackers play a crucial role in protecting networks, businesses, and government agencies from cyber threats.
            With the increasing prevalence of malicious software such as worms, malware, viruses, and ransomware, these organizations face
            the daunting task of updating their networks and implementing effective hacking prevention measures. In the last decade,
            the need for ethical hackers has become more apparent than ever before.
