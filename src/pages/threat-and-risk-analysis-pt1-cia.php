        <p>In this topic I'm going to ignore the hackers and the type of hackers there exist, and I am going to focus on the different types of hacks
            bad individuals will try to carry out on systems. Afterwards I'm going to focus on how a cyber security expert can determine which parts
            of the systems he is maintaining can be compromised using the <b>CIA triad</b> and determine the probability and impact they can leave.</p>

        <p>
            As technology continues to advance, the threat of cyber attacks is becoming increasingly prevalent.
            Cyber attacks are malicious attempts by hackers to breach a system and obtain sensitive information or exploit the system for their benefit.
            In this document, we will discuss the various types of cyber threats that exist and how they can impact our systems.

        <div class="bullet">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Malware (virus, trojan horse, worms, etc.)</b> Malware is a type of software that is designed to
                    infiltrate a system without the user's knowledge.
                    This can lead to the installation of malicious software or the stealing of sensitive information.
                </li>

                <li><b>Spam</b>: Spam is unsolicited email or messages that are sent in bulk to a large number of recipients.
                    It is often used as a method for distributing malware or phishing attacks.
                </li>

                <li><b>Phishing</b>: Phishing is a type of cyber attack that involves the use of fraudulent emails or
                    messages to trick users into giving up their personal information, such as usernames and passwords.
                </li>

                <li><b>Spear phishing</b>: Spear phishing is a more targeted version of phishing, where the attacker
                    specifically targets individuals or organizations with personalized messages that appear to be from a trusted source.
                </li>

                <li><b>Adware</b>: Adware is software that displays unwanted advertisements to users.
                    While it may not be inherently malicious, it can still be a nuisance and can lead to the installation of other unwanted software.
                </li>

                <li><b>Man-in-the-middle attack</b>: A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when a hacker intercepts communication
                    between two parties, allowing them to eavesdrop on conversations or steal sensitive information.
                </li>

                <li><b>Ransomware</b>: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user's files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key.
                </li>

                <li><b>Denial of Service (DOS and DDOS)</b>: DOS and DDOS attacks are designed to overwhelm a system with traffic,
                    making it unusable for legitimate users.
                </li>

                <li><b>Advanced persistent threats</b>: Advanced persistent threats are a type of cyber attack that involves a
                    prolonged and targeted effort to breach a system, often by a well-funded and organized group.
                </li>
