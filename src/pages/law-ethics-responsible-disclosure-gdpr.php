            As Cyber Security Professionals our job is to protect the Confidentiality, Integrity and the Availability of systems and data, that we are constructing,
            maintaining or penetrating. That means that more often than not, we will typically have access to these systems and data beyond what others would have.
            We have the guidelines of the law, but it only tells us what is permissable and what is not, but just because things are legal or illegal, it doesn't necessarily
            mean that what we do is right or wrong. This is where Ethics come into play. 
            </br></br>
            Ethical considerations go beyond what is simply legal or illegal. We, as Professional and as People, must consider the potential impact of our actions and descisions
            on individuals, organizations and society as a whole. Fact: All of the highly regarded cyber security certifications have a code of ethics. If this code
            is broken by the holders of the certificates, they will be taken away. The key takeaways of the codes are: first, always follow the law, always make sure that
            you stay on the right side of it, even if the client asks us to do. Secondly, act honorably, do not sacrifice your own principles to serve someone else. And
            finally call out if you see something that is incorrect/illegal.
            </br></br>
            The key thing to take away from all of this is "Just because you can, doesn't mean you should!".
