        <p>
            Hacking is the process of exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems of networks to gain unauthorized access or control.
            It can be done for variety of reasons, including personal gain, activism, or espionage. <b><u>NOTE!</u></b> Hacking is <b><u>ILLIGAL</u></b>. While it have beneficial outcomes,
            it is considered illigal because it involves unauthorized access to computer systems
            or networks. This can result in theft of sensitive data, disruption of critical services or even damage to computer systems. As a result, hacking is prosecuted as a crime
            and can carry serious legal consequences.
        </p>

        <div class="subtheme">Cyber Kill Chain</div>
        <p>
            The term kill chain is a military concept which identifies the structure of an offensive <b>kinetic</b> attack, which consists of identification of target, dispatching forces to target, initiation of an attack
            and finally destruction of target. The idea of "breaking" the chain is a method of defensive action.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lockheed Martin analysts took the military kill chain and adapted it to the Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) framework,
            which is a methodical approach to counter cybercrime. The CKC aims to guide security experts in infiltrating their
            own systems by following the steps commonly used by actual cybercriminals. This approach enables ethical hackers to conduct
            penetration tests that mimic the steps of a malicious attacker, ultimately enhancing system protection.

            The graphic bellow illustrates the steps:

        <div class="bullet">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Reconnaissance</b> - This first step can be devided in two main categories. The first one could be explained in a social aspect.
                    Example of that being scouring public information about the target i.e emails, domains, job listings, social media, telephone numbers etc.
                    The other one being technical, example: scanning the targets networks, getting all ports, vulnerablity scanners, open terminals, software they use etc.
                    Hackers will look trough what they have gathered to find any vulnerabilities they can exploit.

                </li>
                <li><b>Weapoinization</b> - After finding vulnerabilities about the target, the hacker now must proceed with finding or creating an attack
                    to exploit a weakness. Examples of that can be: Exploit-db, sqlmap, aircrack, social engineering tools, veil framework, wapiti etc. In essence
                    he is creating an exploit for the vulnerability and creating a payload to inject with that exploit.

                </li>
                <li><b>Delivery</b> - After creating the exploit, the hacker in this step must find a way to run his exploit into the targets system. This can be done in various
                    ways like: phishing email attempts, calls, SMS, messages, USB devices, spoofed or fake websites, or executes the code in a service the client offers(website, tool), etc.
                    It is important to note that ethical hackers usually stop at this step, except in rare cases in which they are given permission by their clients.

                </li>
                <li><b>Exploitation</b> - In this step the hacker waits until the victim runs the exploit. Their system getss infected and then the hacker gets access to their targets machine/server.

                </li>
                <li><b>Installation</b> - After getting some kind of access to the targets machine. He needs to install additional malware on the targets machine in order to escalate
                    his current privileges.

                </li>
                <li><b>Command & Control</b> - After gaining root access to the targets systems, he can now fully command & control that system from a remote location. And can finally
                    proceed with his next step.

                </li>
                <li><b>Actions on Objectives</b> - With root access the hacker can now take whatever actions to achieve his goal. Examples stealing data, managing databases, copying or
                    modifiying system files, ransom, sabotage etc. With this root access, the hacker can cover their tracks.

                </li>


            </ul>

        <div class="subtheme">Penetration Testing</div>

        <p>
            A pentest is a security assessment carried out on computer systems or networks to identify vulnerabilities that attackers could
            exploit to gain unauthorized access or compromise data. It involves simulating real-world attacks using various tools and techniques
            to assess the effectiveness of an organization's security controls and to provide recommendations for remediation.
            Essentially it is following the first 3 steps of the Cyber Kill Chain. Here's another way to look at a pentesting:

        </div>

        <p>
            Here's a 5 step process of the most importants aspects of pen-testing:
        </p>

        <div class="bullet">
            <ul>
                <li><b>"Intel Gathering"</b> - Gathering information about the target: company information like telephone-numbers, names, email adresses, websites, etc.

                </li>
                <li><b>"Footprint"</b> -Get an idea about the IT architecture of the target, e.g. ip ranges, active ip adresses, open ports, OS (versions) used, important servers. 

                </li>
                <li><b>"Vuln Analysis"</b> - More in depth (pen)tests to find (known) vulnurabilities in services and applications. 

                </li>
                <li><b>"Exploitation"</b> - Entering the target by using found weaknesses.

                </li>
                <li><b>"Post Exploitation" - important note</b>: Ethical hackers and pentesters normally stop hacking after the exploitation step. 
                In most cases, even exploitation itself will not be part of a pentest because of the risk of destabilising operational IT systems.
                So post exploitation actions (actual extracting, editing, removing data or adding accounts/backdoors) or 
                clean up (clearing logs, removing evidence) are also not performed. With these actions, malicious hackers try to cover his or her tracks.

                </li>


            </ul>

<p>
    In the first week of the specialization, we were introduced to the concept of ethical hacking, as well as the various types of hackers and hacking techniques.
    However, it is crucial to remember that engaging in hacking activities without proper authorization is illegal and can result in legal consequences.
    The only exception is when you have explicit written permission or a contract with the owner of the IT environment you're testing, or if you're testing your own environment.
</p>
<p>
    Ethical hackers play a crucial role in protecting networks, businesses, and government agencies from cyber threats.
    With the increasing prevalence of malicious software such as worms, malware, viruses, and ransomware, these organizations face
    the daunting task of updating their networks and implementing effective hacking prevention measures. In the last decade,
    the need for ethical hackers has become more apparent than ever before.
